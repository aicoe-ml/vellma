# We should have our own README file for Velliv-specific changes to the official Open Web UI repo

## Notes on the vellma3.1:70b base model

I created a new model file, based on the original Llama model file (retrieved with `ollama show --modelfile llama3.1:70b`), and created a new base model using the OpenWebUI interface Admin Settings -> Models. See my comment on [this github issue](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/3106)

I also uploaded the new modified model file to [our fork](./Velliv%20models/vellma.model)
